### ✈️ Flying to Romania

We recommend to check the flights to Bucharest (3 hours), Sibiu (3 hours), Târgu Mureș (3 hours), Bacău (3 hours) and Cluj-Napoca (4 hours) as the airports closest to the city. Of the three, Cluj-Napoca is the furthest away. Bucharest is generally the best connected by public transport.

### Getting around in Romania

#### 🚆 Trains

Most trains are operated by the state-owned company CFR. You can find train schedules at https://www.infofer.ro/. Online tickets often need to be bought a day in advance, otherwise you have to buy them at the stations. The timetable is also available on the website https://www.infofer.ro/. 

A minority of trains are operated by private companies. The most important one is Regio Călători. You can find the timetable of the trains on the website: https://regiocalatori.ro/mersul-trenurilor/#/cautare/ Tickets can also be bought at some of the train stations: https://regiocalatori.ro/mersul-trenurilor/program-case-de-bilete/ This may be particularly relevant for the Bucharest-Brașov route, if you are flying in/out of Bucharest. 

#### 🚌 (Mini) buses 

Intercity minibuses are a good alternative to trains. You can find the schedule of minibuses on the website: https://www.autogari.ro/. 

Some companies also run airport shuttles, for example from Bucharest. The schedule for these can be found on the same website. It might be wise to call/book them in advance. At Otopeni Airport they leave from the ground floor of the parking garage, opposite the building. You need to check if you can book the shuttle to Sfântu Gheorghe or to Brașov. In the latter case, there are other minibuses to Sfântu Gheorghe every half hour from Brașov train station. 

#### 🚗 Car rentals 

The main car rental companies are all present in Romania, usually at the airports, but not only. A local alternative is: https://www.westtaxi.ro/en/ You can also use this company to book a private airport transfer.

#### 🚕 Taxis

Please note that you can only pay for taxis in cash, in Romanian lei. Some of the taxi numbers in Sepsiszentgyörgy are: [+40745161969](call:+40745161969); [+40740439999](call:+40740439999); [+40723484060](call:+40723484060); [+40744839707](call:+40744839707); [+40722271903](call:+40722271903).
